 * Represents a car with priority and size.

 * Cars with highest priority will be taken first, then with the "priority" priority
 * and then all the common cars.
 * If there are cars with the same priority, prefer cars with lower size.
 * So highest-1 (priority status-size) comes before highest-2 which comes before priority-1.
