/**
 * Parking lot is a rectangular area with fixed with and height.
 * Well, rather 2 dimensions on the ground,
 * but as you represent in on the screen, then height can be seen as
 * the vertical axis.
 * The rectangle is filled with parking slots.
 * 3 x 4 parking lot has 12 slots.
 * The size of a slot is 2 units.
 * This means, that car with size 2 fits there perfectly.
 * Car with size 1 takes half the slot, so it could be
 * theoretically shared between 2 small cars.
 * Car with size 4 takes two consecutive slots.
 *
 * Each concrete parking lot type (subclass)
 * has its own rules about which cars it accepts
 * in its queue and how the queue is processed.
 * See the class description for more information.
